## Hi, I'm Ulrich ðŸ‘‹

#### A technologist and aspiring #maker

I've attempted to learn to code a few times in the past, but never managed to stick with it for long enough to become *competent* and *confident* in my ability to build good websites and applications.

This time around, I had to take the time to really think about the **"why"** and **learn how to learn.**

I'm still relatively early on my journey as shown below, but I believe that with enough practice, dedication and the right approach, I should eventually be able to reach the **upswing of awesome** phase in the next few months.
